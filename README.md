You need to have GitHub Desktop installed on your computer. Make sure you are logged in to both the GitHub web site and the GitHub Desktop application.

2. When prompted to save the repository in GitHub Desktop, click 'Clone'. Note which directory on your computer you are saving the files to.

## How to update

1. Open the GitHub Desktop application.

2. In the 'Current Repository' tab, select `practice-solutions` (if it is not already selected).

3. Click the 'Fetch origin' tab. All updates (including examples slides and corrections to old ones) will be downloaded to your computer.
